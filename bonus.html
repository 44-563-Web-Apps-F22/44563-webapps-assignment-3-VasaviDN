        <h1>City Mascot - Dunkirk Discus Fish</h1>
        <p style="background-color:violet">Color : Violet</p>
        <h3>Description of Mascot</h3>
        <p>Dunkirk has the third-largest harbour in France, after those of Le Havre and Marseille.  Due to their distinctive shape, behavior, and bright colors and patterns, discus are popular as freshwater aquarium fish, and their aquaculture in several countries in Asia is a major industry.</p>
        <h3>Three fun facts about the mascot:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not All the Little Ships were Little in Dunkirk</li>
            <li>Discus prefer to congregate in large groups with dozens of members for protection and feeding.</li>
            <li>They appear to derive their bright colors from combinations of pigments within skin cells.</li>
            <li>An alternate name for discus is the “pompadour fish.” Named after Madame de Pompadour, a mistress of King Louis XV of France, the pompadour was a popular hairstyle in which a large volume of hair sweeps over the forehead.</li>
        </ul>
