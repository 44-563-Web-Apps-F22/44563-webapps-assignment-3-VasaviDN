        <h6>Favorite Museum - Louvre Museum :</h6>
        <p>The Louvre's most famous work is Leonardo da Vinci's "<b>Mona Lisa</b>," who enchants hordes of visitors with her enigmatic smile. This small, iconic painting — it is only 21 by 30 inches (53 by 77 centimeters) is covered with bullet-proof glass and flanked by guards, according to the Louvre website. This protection is the result of it being stolen in 1911. (It was recovered in 1913.)</p>
        <p>Crowds also flock to see the armless beauty of the "<b>Venus de Milo</b>," and "<b>Winged Victory</b>," the ancient Greek sculpture also known as "<b>Nike of Samothrace</b>." Other popular works include a stele inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi, da Vinci's tragic sculpture "<b>The Dying Slave</b>" and Antonio Canova's 18th-century sculpture "<b>Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss</b>." <b>Eugene Delacroix's</b> "<b>Liberty Leading the People</b>," which depicts the bare-breasted Liberty goddess leading a charge in the French Revolution, and is thought to have inspired Victor Hugo's "<b>Les Miserables</b>," and Jacques-Louis David's "<b>The Coronation of Napoleon</b>" was commissioned by Napoleon himself and is a good reminder of the Louvre's history.</p>
